# Tilted-rotors hexacopter with a 2 DoF arm simulator
MATLAB/SIMULINK/SIMSCAPE simulator and controller for a tilted-rotors hexacopter with a 2 DoF arm. (MATLAB R2023a)

## How to use it
In Matlab, run the file named init_model. This file initializes the project HexaProject.prj which adds all the required elements to the MATLAB path. It also initializes all the required constants and the trajectory, finally, runs the simulator Hexa_ASMC.slx.
